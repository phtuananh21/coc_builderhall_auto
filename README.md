## ⚡ What is NightVillage-Bot?

NightVillage-Bot is a completely streamlined and customized version of the famous **MyBot.run** project. While the original bot focuses primarily on the Main Village, this project has been heavily modified and optimized **exclusively for Builder Base 2.0 (Night Village) automation**.

All unnecessary UI elements, Main Village detection code, and features have been stripped out to ensure maximum performance and focus on Builder Base farming.

## ✨ Key Features & Improvements
- **100% Builder Base Focus:** Skips the Main Village entirely and jumps straight to Builder Base logic. Hides unrelated UI tabs like Attack Log for a cleaner interface.
- **Optimized Troop Deployment:** Drops all troops efficiently at a single concentrated corner of the base, maximizing attack power.
- **Smart Hero Logic:** Battle Machine & Battle Copter won't waste their ability at Charge 1. The bot intelligently waits ~20 seconds to accumulate a **Level 3 Charge** before activating.
- **Instant Abilities:** Troops with active abilities in BB 2.0 (Night Witch, Cannon Cart, Drop Ship, etc.) will have their abilities triggered *immediately* after deployment.
- **Lightning Fast:** Deployment delays have been massively reduced (300ms for switching troops, 100ms for deploying the same troop type) making attacks incredibly swift.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* **Operating System:** Windows 10 or 11
* **Language:** [AutoIt v3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) installed (if running from source).
* **Emulator:** BlueStacks 5 (or any compatible Android emulator like LDPlayer/MEmu).
* **Game:** Clash of Clans installed and updated on the emulator.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open your Android emulator and launch **Clash of Clans**.
2. Navigate to your **Builder Base** manually (optional but recommended to ensure readiness).
3. Run the `BuilderHall.au3` script using AutoIt, OR launch the compiled `BuilderHall.exe` if available.
4. Go to the **Bot** tab, configure your troop deployment preferences if needed, and click **Start**.
